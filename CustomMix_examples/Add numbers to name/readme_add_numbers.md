CustomMix file should go in:
/etc/enigma2/AutoBouquetsMaker/custom

This will add the official number to the channel name.
The channels not in official bouquets will not get a number

**Enigma2 does not have fixed numbering. The numbers are dynamic and based on the order in which bouquets/channels are loaded.**

This is useful when interrogating swaps etc.
This will break SNPicons because names are changed.

N.B
To show channel numbers on Infobars:
Menu > Setup > System > User Interface > Settings > Show channel number in infobar
Change this to yes and Restart E2 for setting to be applied.

In Grid EPG: Change "Service title mode" to suit your requirements
